/*
* GameApplication - created using OGRE 3D
*
* Author - Janna McLaughlin
*
* Last Date Modified - March 30, 2012
*
* Description:
* Characters run around a lit environment, implementing the A* algorithm to pathfind
* throughout their world. Along the way, they pickup objects. The application
* accepts inputs for changing the light colors in the environment:
*	press 1 to toggle the central light on and off
*	press 2 to get a red light in the top left corner
*	press 3 to get a blue light in the top right corner
*	press 4 to get a green light in the bottom left corner
*	press 5 to change all the light colors to a random color
* Other inputs include:
*	moving the mouse to control where the camera is looking in the world
*	press spacebar to make all the moving characters stop and look at the
*	penguin character sitting still in the center of their world
*
* Additional Notes Concerning GameApplication:
* I did not code the BaseApplication class - this is given out as a part of OGRE3D's
* tutorial package. However, I do have a thorough understanding of the class and could
* write my own class to run the basics for this application.
* The models and their animations and textures are also given out along with OGRE3D, 
* so I do not take credit for any of those.
